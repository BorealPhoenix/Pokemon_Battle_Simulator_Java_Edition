THIS GAME IS BASED ON POKEMON CHARACTERS FOR 'THE POKEMON COMPANY'

I do not pretend to earn any money with this game, I am doing it
just for test my programming skills in Java...

This game is in Alfa Version yet, I have to implement a lot of classes
for improve it, but this is a little advance of how is it going...

NOW YOU CAN ONLY CHOOSE LUCARIO FOR FIGHTING, Zeraora and Zoroark
will be avaliable in the following versions...

I have also implemented the weakness and strength system of the different
pokemon types. 

**A water type attack is more effective against a Fire type Pokemon (for example)**

If you want to check all the weakness and strengths from the Pokemons of the game
I recommend you to search them on the Internet.

My system consist of an attack that is weakness against the Rival Pokemon, loses a 20% of damage
and an attack that is super-effective against the Rival Pokemon earns a 50% of damage.

I know there still could be some bugs, for example you have to press two times the
info bottom of the Pokemon Choosing Panel (Lucario, Zeraora and Zoroark) for see it well...

Or another which is that makes invisible the combat images I implemented when you fight against Scyther 
or Lycanroc, making the screen look white, like if there isn't any image.

I'll try to fix them, and I'll be working hard for unlock Zeraora's and Zoroark's combats.

Thanks for reading this.
